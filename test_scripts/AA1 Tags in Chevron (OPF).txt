In the 23 years I've known<b>
him, it's usually been true.<p>
He has a knack for getting<b>
himself in trouble.<p>
One thing I can say though:<b><wait: 30>
it's usually not his fault.<b>
He just has terrible luck.<p><personvanish: 4 2><wait: 32>
But I know better than anyone,<b>
that he's a good guy at heart.<p><person: 0 0 0>
That and I owe him one.<b>
Which is why I took the<b>
case... to clear his name.<p><bgcolor: 769 8 31><shake: 30 0>

going to do!<nextpage_button><speed: 255><0x26: 1><hidetextbox: 1><bgcolor: 516 1 31><wait: 25><endjmp>
